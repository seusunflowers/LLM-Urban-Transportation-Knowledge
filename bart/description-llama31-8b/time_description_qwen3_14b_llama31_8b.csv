The San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system generally does not operate between midnight and 1:00 AM on most nights. Here's a breakdown of service and ridership during this time:

### Service Availability
- **Standard Operation**: BART typically runs from 5:00 AM to midnight on weekdays and 5:00 AM to 1:00 AM on weekends. However, service is not available between midnight and 1:00 AM on most nights.
- **Exceptions**: On weekends, holidays, or during major events, BART may offer limited late-night service. However, this is not guaranteed and depends on the specific schedule.

### Ridership During 00:00–01:00
- **Typical Ridership**: Zero, as BART does not operate during this time under normal conditions.
- **Exceptions**: If late-night service is in effect, ridership would be very low, likely only a handful of passengers.

### Alternatives for Late-Night Travel
If BART is not operating, travelers may use:
- **BART Night Owl Service**: A limited late-night bus service that connects to BART stations.
- **Local Buses or Ride-Sharing**: Some local transit agencies offer late-night bus routes, and ride-sharing services like Uber or Lyft may be available.

### Key Takeaway
For the 00:00–01:00 window, BART does not provide service on most nights, resulting in zero ridership. Always check the BART schedule or use the BART app for real-time updates on late-night service."

The San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system operates with reduced service during the 1:00–2:00 AM time frame, with ridership being exceptionally low. Here's a breakdown of the service and ridership during this period:

Service During 1:00–2:00 AM:
- Night Owl Service: BART offers Night Owl service on most lines from midnight to 5:00 AM, but not all stations are served. Trains typically run every 15–20 minutes, with frequency varying depending on the day of the week. The Red Line, Blue Line, and Green Line usually maintain service, while other lines may be suspended or have limited service.
- Service Alerts: Nighttime service may be temporarily suspended during holidays, special events, or maintenance. Always check BART’s real-time schedule or Service Alerts for updates.

Ridership During 1:00–2:00 AM:
- Very Low Ridership: BART’s total daily ridership averages around 400,000–500,000 passengers, but nighttime ridership is a small fraction of this. During 1:00–2:00 AM, ridership is typically a few hundred passengers per hour, with most trains carrying 10–20 passengers (if any). Key demographics include shift workers, late-night revelers, and individuals traveling to/from airports.
- Data Sources: BART does not publicly report hour-by-hour ridership for late-night periods, but studies suggest that nighttime service accounts for less than 2% of total annual ridership.

Key Considerations:
- Weekday vs. Weekend: Ridership is even lower on weekdays, with fewer trains and passengers. Weekends see a slight increase due to nightlife activity, but still minimal compared to daytime.
- Events: During major events, BART may increase service temporarily, but this is not standard.
- Safety: BART enforces safety protocols during late-night hours, including increased police presence in stations and trains.

Summary:
- Service: Reduced frequency (every 15–20 minutes) on select lines; not all stations are served.
- Ridership: Extremely low (a few hundred passengers per hour), primarily for late-night workers or travelers.
- Recommendation: For late-night travel, check BART’s real-time maps or use ride-sharing services if service is unavailable.

For precise data, consult BART’s annual reports or contact their customer service for the latest updates."
